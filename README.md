# Implementing K-Means Clustering on the Iris Dataset

K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition data into distinct groups based on their features. In this project, we will implement K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics.

## Dataset Overview

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). Each sample has four features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The goal is to cluster these samples into groups that ideally correspond to the three species.

## Steps to Implement K-Means Clustering

1. **Load the Data**: Download and load the Iris dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Preprocess the Data**: Ensure the data is clean and standardized if necessary.
3. **Apply K-Means Clustering**: Use the K-Means algorithm to cluster the data into groups.
4. **Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters**: Use the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.

## Elbow Method

The elbow method involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The point where the curve bends (or "elbow") indicates the optimal number of clusters. This is because adding more clusters beyond this point results in a marginal decrease in WCSS, indicating that the data is optimally grouped.
